Am creating this app based on the Rails 3 in Action book. However I am using rails rails 3.2 and so some of the code in the book do not work because of update of gems. As such i have corrected them this app. And i will continue updating the app to work with the most recent gems. This code can therefore be used as unofficial Rails 3 in Action Errata code.

Once i complete the tutorial, i will tweak the app to work as a fully working awesome ticketing app
